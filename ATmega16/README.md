Sram and Flash module were generated by Altera Quartus MegaWizard. The samples are in catalogs Altera_Sram and Altera_Flash.
In the same way can be generated from Xilinx Quartus Prime. At the start Flash RAM have to be filled with .mif file,
with 0xFFFF values (file Flash.mif) to avoid unexpected operation of the controller. 
After finishing work with program in Atmel Studio 7.0 two-port RAM can be exchanged by ROM module with suitable two .mif file.
