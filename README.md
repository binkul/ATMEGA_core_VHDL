# ATMEGA-s cores in VHDL language.
## Atmega16 and Atmega32 core in VHDL based on Dr. Juergen Sauermann project for Atmega8 core. 

A few years ago I changed the original design https://docplayer.net/21596341-How-to-design-your-own-cpu-on-fpgas-with-vhdl.html for the Atmega8 controller. The project is not finished and is lying in a drawer, maybe someone will want to use it and finish it. The most important difference from the original is the ability to program 'soft core' directly from Atmel Studio 7.0. I tried to get as close as possible to the original Atmega microcontroller.
In the attached files you can find the original core created by Dr. Jurgen Sauermann with bug fixes and my modifications.

The programs have been tested with:
- CoreEP4CE10 https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/CoreEP4CE10
- Core3S500E https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/Core3S500E
- DVK600 https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/DVK600
